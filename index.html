      <h2>Introduction to Kathmandu</h2>
      <p>
        Kathmandu, the capital city of Nepal, is a city steeped in history and
        culture. Known as the "City of Temples," it is a gateway to the
        Himalayas, offering a unique blend of ancient traditions and modern
        life. This city, with its rich history dating back to the Indus Valley
        Civilization, is a testament to the resilience and creativity of its
        people.
      </p>
      <p>
        The architectural heritage of Kathmandu is unparalleled, with the UNESCO
        World Heritage Sites of Patan Durbar Square and Bhaktapur Durbar Square
        showcasing the city's architectural masterpieces. These sites are a
        tribute to the Newa architecture, a style that has evolved over
        centuries, reflecting the city's cultural diversity and architectural
        ingenuity.

      <h2>Exploring Kathmandu's Attractions</h2>
      <p>
        Kathmandu is a city of spiritual significance, with religious sites that
        draw pilgrims from around the world. The Swayambhunath Stupa, also known
        as the Monkey Temple, is a symbol of peace and enlightenment, attracting
        thousands of visitors each day. Nearby, the Pashupatinath Temple is a
        sacred site for Hindus, where they come to worship Lord Pashupatinath,
        the deity of animals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond its religious sites, Kathmandu offers a glimpse into the natural
        beauty of Nepal. The Chandragiri Hills, a short drive from the city
        center, offer breathtaking views of the city and the Himalayan peaks.
        Whether you choose to hike, drive, or take a cable car, the journey to
        the hills is a must-experience for anyone visiting Kathmandu.
